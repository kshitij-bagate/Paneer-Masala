Method:
-Heat up ghee in a pan. 
-You can use oil or butter in place of ghee.

-When ghee is a little hot & melts a little add cinnamon, star anise, 
  bay leaves, green cardamom and fry for just about 30-40 
  seconds.

-Add finely chopped onion and fry until it melts or gets nice, even 
  golden color for about 7-8 minutes.

-You can use onion puree in place of finely chopped onion. But 
  then you may miss that dhaba style texture.

-Add ginger-garlic paste, kitchen king masala, coriander powder, 
  red chili powder and mix well. 

-You can use garam masala in place of kitchen king masala. 
-Fry the masala for 2 minutes more. 

-Move the masale a little aside and add besan.

-Fry besan for about a minute and mix well with onion masala. 

-Add tomato puree and mix well. 

-Fry everything well for about 6-7 minutes until puree is cooked 
  well.

-Add hot water, salt to taste and mix well.

-Cook the gravy for 2 more minutes. 

-Add paneer, kasuri methi and mix well.

-Cook for just about 3-4 minutes.

-If you cook longer paneer may become chewy.

-Paneer masala is all ready.

-You can have this with roti or naan too.
